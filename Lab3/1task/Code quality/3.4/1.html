The spec in action
Here in the tutorial we’ll be using the following JavaScript libraries for tests:

Mocha – the core framework: it provides common testing functions including describe and it and the main function that runs tests.
Chai – the library with many assertions. It allows to use a lot of different assertions, for now we need only assert.equal.
Sinon – a library to spy over functions, emulate built-in functions and more, we’ll need it much later.
These libraries are suitable for both in-browser and server-side testing. Here we’ll consider the browser variant.
