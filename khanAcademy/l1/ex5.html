        Nobody’s born <strong>smart</strong>. We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s <em>good at anything</em> at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to <strong>learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble</em>, <em>slip</em>, <em>crawl</em>, <em>fall</em> and <em>fail</em> and <em>fall</em>.<br>
        <strong>Frustrating</strong>. <strong>Confusing</strong>. <strong>Trying</strong>. <strong>Struggling</strong>.<br>
        Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each <em>wrong answer</em> making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep <strong>going</strong>.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.
        Because the most <em>beautiful</em>, <em>complex concepts</em> in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that <strong>anyone</strong>, <strong>anywhere</strong> can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever</strong> you are, <strong>wherever</strong> you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
